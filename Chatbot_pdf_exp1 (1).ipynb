This discovery led him to pursue a job at Netscape, a company co-founded by Marc Andreessen, the inventor of Mosaic. Horowitz's decision to join Netscape was driven by his belief in the transformative power of the Internet and his desire to be part of a company that would change the world (Page 16).\n\nThe chapter sets the stage for Horowitz's later experiences as a CEO and entrepreneur, highlighting the pivotal moments and decisions that influenced his career path. It provides a foundation for understanding his perspective on the challenges of building and running a startup, which he explores in more detail throughout the book."

They enjoy gathering information from various sources, making decisions, and engaging in strategic thinking. Ones are characterized by their ability to make decisions even with limited information and their enjoyment of strategic challenges. However, they may get bored with the execution details required to run a company, such as process design and performance management (Page 177).\n\n- **Twos**, on the other hand, enjoy the process of making the company run well. They prefer clear goals and are hesitant to change direction unless necessary. Twos may struggle with strategic thinking and feel anxious about big decisions, often overcomplicating the decision-making process to feel thorough. Despite their love of action, Twos can sometimes halt decision-making in a company due to their cautious nature (Page 178).\n\nHorowitz emphasizes that to be a good CEO, one needs both characteristics. While people tend to be either Ones or Twos, with discipline and hard work, they can become competent in the tasks of the other type. Ignoring the dimension of management one doesn't like can lead to failure, as Ones may end up in chaos and Twos may fail to pivot when necessary (Page 178)."
